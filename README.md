# Ship Log

Ship log is a tool which generates graphs based on your coding activity over a given period of time. 
The name and idea are inspired by the logbook on a maritime vessel. Every day you record important measurements, write a short summary of the day, and save it in the book. This app is supposed to be a logbook for your journey as a developer.

It's a personal project, and I'm still working on it.

## Setup as of 12/14:
1) Clone the repo to your machine
2) Run npm install in the directory with package.json
3) Run npm run dev
4) Navigate to localhost:8080 to see the app

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, React, TailwindCSS, Webpack, PostCSS
**Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, SQLite, WakaTime
**Other**: Jest, VSCode, git

## Planned features:
- Persistent logs
- OAuth to allow user to login and view, delete, edit saved logs
- Graph that changes based on the date
- More graphs
- Switch between manual/automatic input of coding time when adding an entry
- Push notification to update your ship log
- Deployment/Cloud Hosting
- Launch (article, finish docs)
